# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing the framework and rendering your first entity.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0 or later
- TypeScript 5+

## Installation

The framework is a monorepo with several packages. Clone it and install dependencies:

```bash
# from your local clone
# cd /path/to/ecs-dom-test
bun install
```

## Core Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@ecs-test/ecs` | Core ECS engine — World, entities, components, systems |
| `@ecs-test/dom` | DOM renderer — bridges ECS to the browser |
| `@ecs-test/forms` | Type-safe form state management |
| `@ecs-test/forms-ui` | ECS bindings for forms |

## Your First World

Create a minimal application that renders a button:

<div data-code-tabs>

```tsx
import { World, Entity, materialize } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { registerDOMSystems, DOMElement, TextContent } from "@ecs-test/dom";

// 1. Create a world with DOM externals
const world = new World({
  externals: {
    createElement: document.createElement.bind(document),
    rootContainer: document.getElementById("root")!,
    window,
    console,
  },
});

// 2. Register DOM systems
registerDOMSystems(world);

// 3. Define your UI as JSX
const ui = (
  <Entity>
    <DOMElement tag="button" />
    <TextContent value="Button" />
  </Entity>
);

// 4. Materialize and flush
materialize(world, ui);
world.flush();
```

```ts
import { World } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { registerDOMSystems, DOMElement, TextContent } from "@ecs-test/dom";

const world = new World({
  externals: {
    createElement: document.createElement.bind(document),
    rootContainer: document.getElementById("root")!,
    window,
    console,
  },
});

registerDOMSystems(world);

const button = world.createEntity();
world.add(button, DOMElement({ tag: "button" }));
world.add(button, TextContent({ value: "Button" }));

world.flush();
```

</div>

## Running the Dev Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the docs application (typically on `localhost:3001`) with live examples and API docs.

## Live Editor (Isolated Preview)

You can also embed a live editor with an isolated iframe renderer. Editing code updates the iframe preview.
TypeScript and JSX are transpiled before execution, and the template follows the global JSX/Non-JSX mode selection used by code tabs:

<div data-live-editor data-example="manual-button" data-height="220"></div>

Authoring notes for docs contributors:
- Use `data-live-editor` with `data-example="example-id"` to place a live example.
- Monaco (with TS autocomplete/hover) is the default editor.
- Monaco type information is loaded from generated package declarations (`/playground/types`) during docs build.
- Use `data-editor="textarea"` only when Monaco must be disabled for a specific example.

## Next Steps

- [Concepts](/overview/concepts.html) — understand entities, components, and systems in depth
