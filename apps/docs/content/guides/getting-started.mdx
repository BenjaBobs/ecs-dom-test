# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing the framework and rendering your first entity.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0 or later
- TypeScript 5+

## Installation

The framework is a monorepo with several packages. Clone it and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ecs-ui-framework.git
cd ecs-ui-framework
bun install
```

## Core Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@ecs-test/ecs` | Core ECS engine — World, entities, components, systems |
| `@ecs-test/dom` | DOM renderer — bridges ECS to the browser |
| `@ecs-test/forms` | Type-safe form state management |
| `@ecs-test/forms-ui` | ECS bindings for forms |

## Your First World

Create a minimal application that renders a button:

```tsx
import { World, Entity, materialize } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { registerDOMSystems, DOMElement, Clickable } from "@ecs-test/dom";

// 1. Create a world with DOM externals
const world = new World({
  externals: {
    createElement: document.createElement.bind(document),
    rootContainer: document.getElementById("root")!,
    window,
    console,
  },
});

// 2. Register DOM systems
registerDOMSystems(world);

// 3. Define your UI as JSX
const ui = (
  <Entity>
    <DOMElement tag="button" />
    <Clickable onClick={() => {
      console.log("Button clicked!");
    }} />
  </Entity>
);

// 4. Materialize and flush
materialize(world, ui);
world.flush();
```

## Running the Dev Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts the playground application at `localhost:3000` where you can experiment with the framework.
