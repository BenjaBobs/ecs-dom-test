# Roadmap

This roadmap is for the entire project, not just the docs app.

Primary strategy:
- Build the docs product using the framework (dogfooding).
- Use that work to discover real framework pain points.
- In parallel, draft a practical UI standard library for building basic apps.

## Current Priority Order

1. `R1` Dogfooded Docs Product + Pain-Point Discovery Loop
2. `R2` UI Standard Library Draft (`@ecs-test/ui`)
3. `R3` Framework Ergonomics and Footgun Reduction (driven by R1 findings)
4. `R4` Platform Hardening (debug/profiling/testing/perf)

## Milestones

### R1. Dogfooded Docs Product + Discovery Loop (In Progress)

- Status: `in_progress`
- Why first:
  - it exercises real-world ECS usage continuously
  - it reveals missing features, friction, and architectural footguns quickly
- Scope:
  - docs shell and interactions implemented as ECS
  - API docs + search + navigation + playground embeds
  - ongoing capture of friction points while developing docs features
- Exit criteria:
  - docs experience is stable and usable for contributors
  - a maintained list of concrete friction findings exists and is actionable

### R2. UI Standard Library Draft (In Progress)

- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal:
  - define a baseline set of reusable UI components for typical app scaffolding
- Scope:
  - basic primitives (buttons, inputs, layout, cards, nav patterns)
  - ECS-friendly composition patterns and bundles
  - docs/examples demonstrating intended usage
- Exit criteria:
  - initial usable component set exists in `@ecs-test/ui`
  - building a small app no longer requires repetitive low-level boilerplate

### R3. Framework Ergonomics + Flexibility Improvements (Planned)

- Status: `planned`
- Inputs:
  - issues discovered while executing R1/R2
- Focus areas:
  - overly verbose syntax
  - inflexible composition points
  - missing primitives/features
  - developer footguns and unsafe defaults
- Exit criteria:
  - high-impact friction items are resolved or intentionally deferred with rationale
  - docs and examples reflect improved patterns

### R4. Platform Hardening (Planned / Ongoing)

- Status: `planned`
- Notes:
  - core runtime and DOM renderer are likely near-done functionally
  - this track remains important, but not primary right now
- Scope:
  - debug/profiling polish
  - reliability and regression testing
  - targeted performance work when evidence requires it
- Exit criteria:
  - hardening tasks are driven by observed issues, not speculative work

## Discovery Protocol (For R1/R2)

When building features, capture findings in categories:
- `footgun`: easy-to-make mistakes with costly outcomes
- `verbosity`: too much code/noisy syntax for common patterns
- `inflexibility`: valid UI composition that framework resists
- `missing_feature`: needed capability absent in core/dom/forms/ui

Each finding should include:
- short title
- reproducible context
- impact
- proposed direction
- milestone link (`R3` by default unless urgent)

Record findings in the [Friction Log](/repo/friction-log.html).

## Out of Immediate Focus

- major new debugging platform initiatives unless they block R1/R2
- speculative optimization work without measured pain
- release/versioned docs strategy before core dogfooding goals are met

## Success Criteria

- The docs project continuously improves the framework through real usage feedback.
- A practical UI standard library exists and is used by docs/demo apps.
- Roadmap and working set stay tightly aligned with this priority order.
