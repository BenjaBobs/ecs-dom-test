# Friction Log

This log captures framework friction discovered while building the docs app and the UI standard library.

Use this with:
- [Roadmap](/repo/roadmap.html) for milestone context
- [Working Set](/repo/working-set.html) for active execution state

## Categories

- `footgun`: easy-to-make mistakes with high cost
- `verbosity`: too much code for common patterns
- `inflexibility`: valid composition the framework currently resists
- `missing_feature`: capability needed but not present

## Active Findings

- ID: FR-20260214-04
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Category: `verbosity`
- Context: Building interactive docs examples requires substantial boilerplate (`defineMarker`, query lookups, manual label update systems) even for simple counters.
- Impact: Intro examples become long, making onboarding harder and obscuring core ECS ideas.
- Proposed direction: Add higher-level example primitives and tiny helper bundles in `@ecs-test/ui` for common patterns (counter state + button wiring + label binding).
- Milestone: `R3`
- Status: `todo`

## Completed Findings

- ID: FR-20260214-01
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Category: `footgun`
- Context: Live editor Monaco typing initially used handwritten shims; they drifted from real package APIs and produced false diagnostics.
- Impact: Docs examples showed incorrect type errors, reducing trust in examples and in framework typings.
- Proposed direction: Generate and load real package `.d.ts` files for live editor typing.
- Milestone: `R3`
- Status: `done`

- ID: FR-20260214-02
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Category: `footgun`
- Context: JSX runtime helper imports and `Entity` imports came from different module instances, causing silent render failures (white iframe).
- Impact: No visible output without actionable errors; hard to debug for users and maintainers.
- Proposed direction: Enforce shared runtime identity (`jsx/jsxs/jsxDEV` and `Entity`) by exporting helpers from `@ecs-test/ecs` and using a stable runtime import path.
- Milestone: `R3`
- Status: `done`

- ID: FR-20260214-03
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Category: `missing_feature`
- Context: Docs dev loop originally regenerated API docs on every start/rebuild.
- Impact: Slow startup/rebuild times hurt iteration speed while dogfooding.
- Proposed direction: Add fast dev mode with selective API regeneration when package sources change.
- Milestone: `R3`
- Status: `done`
