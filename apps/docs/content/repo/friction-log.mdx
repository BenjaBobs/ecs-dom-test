# Friction Log

This log captures framework friction discovered while building the docs app and the UI standard library.

Use this with:
- [Roadmap](/repo/roadmap.html) for milestone context
- [Working Set](/repo/working-set.html) for active execution state

## Categories

- `footgun`: easy-to-make mistakes with high cost
- `verbosity`: too much code for common patterns
- `inflexibility`: valid composition the framework currently resists
- `missing_feature`: capability needed but not present
