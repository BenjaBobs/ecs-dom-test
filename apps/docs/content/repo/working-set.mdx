# Working Set

Execution board for both humans and agents.

## Rules

- Every active task maps to a roadmap milestone (`R1`..`R4`).
- Keep statuses current: `todo` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `done`.
- Use priorities: `P0` (highest) to `P3` (lowest).
- Add dated entries to `Recently Completed` when tasks finish.
- Track all discovered friction items in [Friction Log](/repo/friction-log.html).

## Alignment Snapshot

Primary active milestones:
- `R1` Dogfooded Docs Product + Discovery Loop
- `R2` UI Standard Library Draft

Secondary (supporting) milestone:
- `R3` Framework Ergonomics + Flexibility Improvements

## Active Tasks

| ID | Status | Priority | Milestone | Task | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-R1-001 | in_progress | P0 | R1 | Keep docs app feature-complete via ECS dogfooding | Stable docs runtime with real ECS usage patterns. |
| WS-R1-002 | in_progress | P0 | R1 | Add and maintain friction log from docs development | Concrete footguns/verbosity/inflexibility/missing-feature findings. |
| WS-R1-003 | todo | P1 | R1 | Tighten docs UX and navigation flow | Cleaner contributor path through guides/repo/api/examples. |
| WS-R2-001 | in_progress | P0 | R2 | Draft initial `@ecs-test/ui` primitive set | First pass of reusable UI bundles/components. |
| WS-R2-002 | todo | P1 | R2 | Use `@ecs-test/ui` primitives in docs surfaces where sensible | Validate primitives through real usage. |
| WS-R2-003 | todo | P2 | R2 | Document usage patterns for each primitive | API docs + examples for quick adoption. |
| WS-R3-001 | todo | P1 | R3 | Convert top friction findings into actionable framework tasks | Prioritized implementation queue. |
| WS-R4-001 | todo | P2 | R4 | Add targeted regression tests for discovered pain points | Prevent repeat breakage from resolved issues. |

## Friction Log Template (R1/R3)

Use [Friction Log](/repo/friction-log.html) and this shape for each finding:

```md
- ID: FR-YYYYMMDD-XX
- Category: footgun | verbosity | inflexibility | missing_feature
- Context:
- Impact:
- Proposed direction:
- Milestone: R3
- Status: todo | in_progress | done
```

## Blocked Tasks

| ID | Blocked By | Unblock Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WS-R4-001 | Initial friction backlog not curated | Finalize first prioritized R3 queue. |

## Recently Completed

- [x] 2026-02-14 ECS docs shell, API generation, and playground hydration baseline.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Repository docs section established (`Design Choices`, `Roadmap`, `Working Set`).

## Backlog (Unscheduled)

- CI/CD + release/versioning strategy (after R1/R2 maturity).
- Larger debugging platform expansion not required by current dogfooding needs.
