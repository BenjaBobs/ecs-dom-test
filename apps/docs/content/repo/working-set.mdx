# Working Set

Execution board for both humans and agents.

## Rules

- Every active task maps to a roadmap milestone (`R1`..`R4`).
- Keep statuses current: `todo` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `done`.
- Use priorities: `P0` (highest) to `P3` (lowest).
- Add dated entries to `Recently Completed` when tasks finish.
- Track all discovered friction items in [Friction Log](/repo/friction-log.html).

## Alignment Snapshot

Primary active milestones:
- `R1` Dogfooded Docs Product + Discovery Loop

Secondary (supporting) milestone:
- `R2` UI Standard Library Draft
- `R3` Framework Ergonomics + Flexibility Improvements

## Active Tasks

| ID | Status | Priority | Milestone | Task | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-R1-001 | in_progress | P0 | R1 | Keep docs app feature-complete via ECS dogfooding | Stable docs runtime with real ECS usage patterns. |
| WS-R1-002 | in_progress | P0 | R1 | Add and maintain friction log from docs development | Concrete footguns/verbosity/inflexibility/missing-feature findings. |
| WS-R1-003 | in_progress | P0 | R1 | Live editor v2 (multi-example support, diagnostics, global mode sync) | Reliable editable examples for JSX/non-JSX with isolated previews. |
| WS-R1-004 | done | P0 | R1 | Build-time internal/API link validation | Broken refs fail the docs build instead of shipping 404s. |
| WS-R1-005 | todo | P1 | R1 | Move live example sources to `apps/docs/examples` + generated manifest | Docs runtime reads examples from build artifact, not hardcoded system maps. |
| WS-R1-006 | todo | P1 | R1 | Add page metadata UX (`Edit this page`, `Last updated`) | Better contributor/documentation workflow visibility. |
| WS-R1-007 | todo | P1 | R1 | Add section TOC for long docs pages | Faster navigation for `overview/*` and `repo/*`. |
| WS-R1-008 | todo | P1 | R1 | Tighten docs UX and navigation flow | Cleaner contributor path through guides/repo/api/examples. |
| WS-R1-009 | done | P1 | R1 | Add TypeScript autocomplete + hover for live editors | Monaco-backed authoring shipped with TS language tooling and textarea fallback. |
| WS-R1-010 | done | P0 | R1 | Remove legacy playground app and replace with guide-first small app walkthrough | No standalone playground dependency; docs contains canonical feature-sampling app guide. |
| WS-R2-001 | todo | P0 | R2 | Draft initial `@ecs-test/ui` primitive set | First pass of reusable UI bundles/components. |
| WS-R2-002 | todo | P1 | R2 | Use `@ecs-test/ui` primitives in docs surfaces where sensible | Validate primitives through real usage. |
| WS-R2-003 | todo | P2 | R2 | Document usage patterns for each primitive | API docs + examples for quick adoption. |
| WS-R3-001 | todo | P1 | R3 | Convert top friction findings into actionable framework tasks | Prioritized implementation queue. |
| WS-R4-001 | todo | P2 | R4 | Add targeted regression tests for discovered pain points | Prevent repeat breakage from resolved issues. |
| WS-R4-002 | todo | P1 | R4 | Add `docs:check` CI gate (build + link checks + docs assertions) | Prevent stale docs and broken docs routes from landing. |

## Friction Log Template (R1/R3)

Use [Friction Log](/repo/friction-log.html) and this shape for each finding:

```md
- ID: FR-YYYYMMDD-XX
- Category: footgun | verbosity | inflexibility | missing_feature
- Context:
- Impact:
- Proposed direction:
- Milestone: R3
- Status: todo | in_progress | done
```

## Blocked Tasks

| ID | Blocked By | Unblock Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WS-R4-001 | Initial friction backlog not curated | Finalize first prioritized R3 queue. |

## Recently Completed

- [x] 2026-02-14 ECS docs shell, API generation, and playground hydration baseline.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Repository docs section established (`Design Choices`, `Roadmap`, `Working Set`, `Friction Log`).
- [x] 2026-02-14 Synchronized JSX/non-JSX code tabs added for docs examples.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Live editor baseline added (`data-live-editor`) with isolated iframe previews and editable code.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Build-time internal link validation added to docs pipeline (build now fails on broken internal links).
- [x] 2026-02-14 Live editor now follows global JSX/non-JSX mode selection without overriding edited code.
- [x] 2026-02-14 `docs:dev` fast mode added (skips API regeneration by default; regenerates when `packages/` changes).
- [x] 2026-02-14 Live editor upgraded to Monaco (TS autocomplete/hover) with automatic textarea fallback.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Live editor Monaco typings switched from handwritten shims to generated package `.d.ts` declarations.
- [x] 2026-02-14 Live editor type build now includes source `.d.ts` augmentations (for example DOM `WorldExternals` augmentation).
- [x] 2026-02-14 Removed `apps/playground`; replaced with `Build a Small App` guide and docs-focused dev flow.

## Backlog (Unscheduled)

- CI/CD + release/versioning strategy (after R1/R2 maturity).
- Larger debugging platform expansion not required by current dogfooding needs.
