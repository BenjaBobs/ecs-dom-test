# ECS UI Framework

A research project exploring **Entity Component System** architecture for browser UI. Instead of component trees with props and state, UI is built from entities, data components, and reactive systems.

## Why ECS for UI?

Traditional UI frameworks couple behavior to component identity. ECS decouples them — behavior emerges from the _combination_ of data attached to an entity, not from its position in a tree.

- **Entities** are just IDs — lightweight UI nodes
- **Components** are pure data — state, styles, event handlers
- **Systems** are reactive functions — they run when component membership changes
- **Bundles** are reusable groups of components — composable building blocks

## Quick Example

<div data-code-tabs>

```tsx
import { World, Entity, materialize } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { DOMElement, Classes, TextContent } from "@ecs-test/dom";

const world = new World({ externals: { /* ... */ } });

const ui = (
  <Entity>
    <DOMElement tag="button" />
    <Classes list={["btn", "btn-primary"]} />
    <TextContent value="Click me" />
  </Entity>
);

materialize(world, ui);
world.flush();
```

```ts
import { World } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { DOMElement, Classes, TextContent } from "@ecs-test/dom";

const world = new World({ externals: { /* ... */ } });

const button = world.createEntity();
world.add(button, DOMElement({ tag: "button" }));
world.add(button, Classes({ list: ["btn", "btn-primary"] }));
world.add(button, TextContent({ value: "Click me" }));

world.flush();
```

</div>
