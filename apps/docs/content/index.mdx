# ECS UI Framework

A research project exploring **Entity Component System** architecture for browser UI. Instead of component trees with props and state, UI is built from entities, data components, and reactive systems.

## Why ECS for UI?

Traditional UI frameworks couple behavior to component identity. ECS decouples them — behavior emerges from the _combination_ of data attached to an entity, not from its position in a tree.

- **Entities** are just IDs — lightweight UI nodes
- **Components** are pure data — state, styles, event handlers
- **Systems** are reactive functions — they run when component membership changes
- **Bundles** are reusable groups of components — composable building blocks

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { World, Entity, materialize } from "@ecs-test/ecs";
import { DOMElement, Clickable, Classes } from "@ecs-test/dom";

const world = new World({ externals: { /* ... */ } });

const ui = (
  <Entity>
    <DOMElement tag="button" />
    <Classes classes={["btn", "btn-primary"]} />
    <Clickable onClick={() => console.log("clicked!")} />
  </Entity>
);

materialize(world, ui);
world.flush();
```
